[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ethereum/cpp-ethereum.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)

Ethereum is based on a design in an original whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. This implementation is based on the formal specification of a refinement of that idea detailed in the 'yellow paper' by Gavin Wood. Contributors, builders and testers include:

- *arkpar* (**Arkadiy Paronyan**) Mix, PV61/BlockQueue
- *debris* (**Marek Kotewicz**) JSONRPC, web3.js
- *CJentzsch* (**Christoph Jentzsch**) tests, lots of tests
- *LefterisJP* (**Lefteris Karapetsas**) Solidity, libethash
- *chriseth* (**Christian Reitwiessner**) Solidity
- *subtly* (**Alex Leverington**) libp2p, rlpx
- *yann300* (**Yann Levreau**) Mix
- *LianaHus* (**Liana Husikyan**) Solidity
- *chfast* (**Pawe≈Ç Bylica**) EVMJIT
- *cubedro* (**Marian Oancea**) web3.js
- *gluk256* (**Vlad Gluhovsky**) Whisper
- *programmerTim* (**Tim Hughes**) libethash-cl

And let's not forget: Caktux (neth, ongoing CI), Eric Lombrozo (original MinGW32 cross-compilation), Marko Simovic (original CI).
